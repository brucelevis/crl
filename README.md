# CRL

This repo is called CRL meaning 'C++ Rogue Like'... As long as I do not have a name for this creation I will keep it at that. It could change in the future though...

# Dependencies

To run compiled binary the libBearLibTerminal.so library is required. It is possible to get this from: http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal. For convience this is also added to the /lib folder. To install manually just copy it to /usr/lib or something... whatever makes one happy ;)

# Building

To build run 'autoreconf' and then './configure', 'make' and finally 'make install'
